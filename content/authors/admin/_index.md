## Bio

I'm a computational biologist working at the interface of data science and biology — applying statistical and machine learning approaches to uncover structure in complex biological data. I am a senior scientist at Arquimea Research Centre, La Laguna, Spain.

My background spans experimental biology, computational modeling, and bioinformatics. After completing a PhD at Lund University focused on visual systems in invertebrates, I transitioned toward data-driven biology — developing analytical tools and predictive models that bridge biological insight and computation.

I enjoy learning new analytical methods, writing code, and communicating science clearly. My goal is to continue growing as a biological data scientist, expanding across diverse fields within the life sciences while keeping biological meaning at the core of the analysis.
